# Sibra-s-network ðŸšŒ
  A python console app of Annecy's bus network (SIBRA). The purpose of this project is to apply the concept of graph theory in real world application.
  By implementing a data structure from raw data, this app will allow you to find the shortest path between two bus stops (the path with the fewest stop), the fastest (in time, it might have the most bus stop) and the path which will allow you to arrive the earliest. For the moment, there are only two bus lines, but more will be implemented in the future.
